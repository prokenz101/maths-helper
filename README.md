# Maths Helper

A simple python script that helps you with basic math questions.

## It helps you with:
- Basic Operations
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
- Square and Square Root
- Perimeter and Area

## How to use the script

When it asks for a command, Your options are `calculator`, `perimeter`, `area`, `square`, `square root`, `quit` and ` pythagorean theorem`.
The operations for `calculator` are `+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), `/` (Division) and `%` (Remainder).

When it asks for shapes, your options are `Square` and `Rectangle` length/breadth/side in `perimeter` or `area` just input a random number I guess its not that hard.

For `Square Root` and `Square` its basically just the same thing, enter a number.

For `Pythagorean Theorem` (This is the most complex but still pretty easy) you gotta input the state of the 3 sides of the triangle. Basically defining whether it's there or not, You do this using `yes` or `no`. Once the script gets this info, it will ask you the numbers according to the presence of each side of the triangle. If you dont know what the altitude is, then it's not going to ask you what it is. Once you do this, the answer will be outputted in square root(obviously). If hypotenuse is there, then make sure that the value is larger than the base/altitude otherwise it just wont make sense. And also, don't try and fake it out by saying that you have all 3 sides, It Knows.

You can also `quit` at any point while using the script if you would like to stop. Just type `quit`.

## Examples
```
What do you want me to do? calculator
Operation? *
First Number? 12
Second Number? 4
The Answer is: 48
*Program Exits*
```
Or

```
What do you want me to do? area
Square or Rectangle? square
What is the side of the square? 6
The Answer is: 36
*Program Exits*
```
Or

```
What do you want me to do? square root
What is the number you want to find the square root of? 16
The Answer is: 4
*Program Exits*
```
Or

```
What do you want me to do? perimeter
Square or Rectangle? quit
*Program Exits*
```
Or

```
What do you want me to do? pythagorean theorem
Do you have the altitude? yes
Do you have the base? yes
Do you have the hypotenuse? no
What is the altitude? 10
What is the base? 5
The Answer Is: 11.180339887498949
*Program Exits*
```

If it doesn't work, then

## L.

Also don't type any text in areas where you aren't supposed to. It's just not gonna end well.

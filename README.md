# Maths Helper

A simple python script that helps you with basic math questions.

## It helps you with:
- Calculator
   Basic Operations
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
- Square and Cube Root
    Random Number
    - 24 (Example)
- Perimeter and Area
    Shapes
    - Rectangle
    - Square
    - Circle
    - Triangle
    - Paralellogram
- Hypotenuse, Altitude and Base
    2 Random Numbers
    - 24 and 48 (Example)
- LCM and HCF
    2 Random Numbers
    - 24 and 48 (Example)


## How to use the script

When it asks for a command, Your options are `calculator`, `perimeter`, `area`, `square`, `square root`, `cube root` `quit`, `hyp`, `alt`, `base`, `lcm`, `hcf`.
The operations for `calculator` are `+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), `/` (Division) and `%` (Remainder).

When it asks for shapes, your options are `Square`, `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Triangle` and `Parallelogram`  length/breadth/side/radius/diameter/base in `perimeter` or `area` just input a random number I guess its not that hard.

For `Square Root`, `Square` and `Cube Root` it's basically just the same thing, enter a number.

For `Hyp` (Hypotenuse), you can just input the altitude and base of the triangle and it should give you the hypotenuse of them.

For `Alt` (Altitude), you can just input the hypotenuse and base of the triangle and it should give you the altitude of them.

For `Base` you can just input the hypotenuse and the altitude of the triangle and it should give you the base of them.

For `HCF` just type in 2 numbers and it should output the HCF of those 2 numbers. 

For `LCM` just type in 2 numbers and it should output the LCM of those 2 numbers. 

If you would like to go back to the previous question that the script asked, just type `..`, similar to changing directories in terminal.

You can also `quit` at any point while using the script if you would like to stop. Just type `quit`.

If it doesn't work, then

## L.

Also don't type any text in areas where you aren't supposed to. It's just not gonna end well.

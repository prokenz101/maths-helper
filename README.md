# Maths Helper

A simple python script that helps you with basic math questions.

## It helps you with:
- Basic Operations
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
- Square and Square Root
- Perimeter and Area

## How to use the script

When it asks for a command, Your options are `calculator`, `perimeter`, `area`, `square` and `square root`.
The operations for `calculator` are `+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), `/` (Division) and `%` (Remainder).

When it asks for shapes, your options are `Square` and `Rectangle` length/breadth/side in `perimeter` or `area` just input a random number I guess its not that hard.

For `Square Root` and `Square` its basically just the same thing, enter a number.

You can also `quit` at any point while using the script if you would like to stop. Just type `quit`.
